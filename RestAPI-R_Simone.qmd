## How softwares communicated before APIs?

Communication between software was difficult before APIs, because:

-   **No standard interface:** programs had to know each other's internal structure to communicate.

-   **Incompatibility:** different languages, platforms, or data formats made integration hard.\

-   **Fragile communication:** every connection required custom, error-prone code.

## What is an API? {background-color=#ffe66d}

> **API (Application Programming Interface):**\
> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality.[^1]


Most of the API's use the client-server paradigm
